# DIabetesPrediction-Using-MachineLearningAlgorithm
Diabetes is considered as one of the deadliest and chronic diseases which causes an increase in blood sugar. Today it is common to different age groups ranging from children to adults. With diabetes patients, doubling every year especially in India there is a need to curb this epidemic and help those who are affected by this disease so that they can live a peaceful life. Continuous monitoring of health indicators ensures prompt medical attention and reduction in fatalities. Annually it costs a lot of money to care for people with diabetes. Many complications occur if diabetes remains untreated and unidentified. The tedious identifying process results in visiting of a patient to a diagnostic centre and consulting doctor, but the rise in machine learning approaches solves this critical problem. Thus the most important issue is the prediction to be very accurate and to use a reliable method for that. In our project, we assess the ability of some of the classifiers like SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boost , Ada Boost.
